# Little Lemon Restaurant Website

## Inroduction
This is a META's Front End specialisation project from coursera. In this project, from the beginning with figma wireframe design and figma UI design, I created a restaurant website with ReactJS. I tried to use all the features of ReactJS. I made a table reservation system, menu , functions to add orders, add items to cart , remove items delete items and reservation etc.
